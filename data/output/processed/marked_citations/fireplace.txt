3D scene generation and object placement. Significant
efforts have been made towards collecting 3D scene datasets
[CITATION_0], enabling the community to train
and develop systems that generate and/or position elements
within indoor scenes [CITATION_1]. While
they demonstrate that object placement rules can be dis-
tilled from scene databases, these were not designed to han-
dle open vocabularies of objects, and even less so to take
into account the level of common sense reasoning that un-
derlies human decisions to place objects where they are
placed within our living environments. FirePlace intro-
duces a method to leverage the knowledge of MLLMs to
do this in a training-free manner. While other works [CITATION_2] use
2D image priors to generate scenes and objects, they often
have issues preserving object identity and physical plausi-
bility of the final object arrangement. In contrast, FirePlace
works with an explicit 3D scene representation, where ex-
plicit geometric constraints are enforced.
Foundation models for 3D graphics. More recent
works [CITATION_3] have demonstrated the potential
of involving large pretrained models for different stages of
the 3D graphical design process. While they demonstrate
capabilities in editing materials [CITATION_4], texture [CITATION_5], and con-
trolling animation [CITATION_6], they struggle with tasks that require
complex spatial reasoning, like object placement. Existing
works like [CITATION_7] have attempted to position objects in a scene

by directly using LLMs through predicting the position and
orientation of objects as LLM outputs. More recent works
[CITATION_8] have demonstrated the benefit of using LLMs
to predict constraints instead, before using a solver to solve
for final object placements. However, despite being able
to create large-scale scenes, they represent each object us-
ing bounding boxes, making it impossible to express fine-
grained constraints between parts of objects, leading to con-
straints that can only explain placements of box-like objects
(as opposed to putting a book on a shelf, or a stuffed toy on
a chair with a backrest and armrests). This design choice is
understandable, since parts of objects become increasingly
hard for LLMs to reason about. FirePlace introduces a way
to overcome this limitation.
