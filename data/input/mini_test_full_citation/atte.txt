The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
++ref++[ (Łukasz Kaiser and Samy Bengio. Can active memory replace attention? In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (NIPS), 2016.) ]++ref++, ByteNet ++ref++[ (Nal Kalchbrenner, Lasse Espeholt, Karen Simonyan, Aaron van den Oord, Alex Graves, and Ko- ray Kavukcuoglu. Neural machine translation in linear time. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.10099v2, 2017.) ]++ref++ and ConvS2S ++ref++[ (Jonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N. Dauphin. Convolu- tional sequence to sequence learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.03122v2, 2017.) ]++ref++, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions ++ref++[ (Sepp Hochreiter, Yoshua Bengio, Paolo Frasconi, and Jürgen Schmidhuber. Gradient flow in recurrent nets: the difficulty of learning long-term dependencies, 2001.) ]++ref++. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations ++ref++[ (Jianpeng Cheng, Li Dong, and Mirella Lapata. Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading. arXiv preprint arXiv:1601.06733, 2016. 10), (Ankur Parikh, Oscar Täckström, Dipanjan Das, and Jakob Uszkoreit. A decomposable attention model.

A structured self-attentive sentence embedding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.03130, 2017.) ]++ref++.

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks ++ref++[ (Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Arthur Szlam, Jason Weston, and Rob Fergus. End-to-end memory networks. In C. Cortes, N. D. Lawrence, D. D. Lee, M. Sugiyama, and R. Garnett, editors, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 2440–2448. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.) ]++ref++.

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as ++ref++[ (Łukasz Kaiser and Ilya Sutskever. Neural GPUs learn algorithms.
